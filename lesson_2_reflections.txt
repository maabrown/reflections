What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?------

When initializing a repository it gives the computer the 'go' to track changes
in the files that you are planning on using.

It is important because it starts to track changes and allows you to write
messages for the commits you plan to make.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it is
holding the files that you are using in the working directory but before you
have commit them to respository (which is filled with your 'final or 'updated'
drafts). Staging area is different from repository because files in the 
staging area are not finalized and saved in their current form - so they are
still relatively flexible. Files in the repository are in their most updated
or final forms - will no flexibility unless you open them, make changes, store
them in the staging area, and then commit them.

It offers the chance for developers to make sure that they are commit'ing the
right files. It also allows them to see which files they have open - which
can be useful if you are working on multiple projects at the same time.
