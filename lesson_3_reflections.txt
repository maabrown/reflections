When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I think it is smart to keep a remote repository because it allows for
    team collaboration regardless of where the team members are. It also provides
    a back-up in case your personal computer breaks down.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I think you want it to be manual because Git, if it was automatic, could
    potentially pull changes too often without you having done anything
    substantial enough to require a commit. In addition, if you were working
    in a particular branch, Git could update and save your work in the wrong
    branch. Pulling changes manually allows the developer to have more
    control over the number of commits and be conscious of his work in
    relationship to what is saved on his local device, and what is hosted
    publically on Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks - cloning repositories that are hosted on GitHub that are
        'owned' by other people, your code is in relationship to their code
        -- used to get access to someone's code that is online

    Clones - making direct copies of code from GitHub or a local computer
        -- used to work on code offline
        -- used when code doesn't require attribution, used to transfer
            code from online to offline since it can't be done via forking

    Branches - lineages of commits that can be hosted on GitHub and on a
        local computer, branches are what are cloned and forked
        -- when you save commits, you are saving them to branches
        -- branches are the names that you use to tell GitHub which ones
            to push/pull
