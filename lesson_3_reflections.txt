When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I think it is smart to keep a remote repository because it allows for
    team collaboration regardless of where the team members are. It also provides
    a back-up in case your personal computer breaks down.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I think you want it to be manual because Git, if it was automatic, could
    potentially pull changes too often without you having done anything
    substantial enough to require a commit. In addition, if you were working
    in a particular branch, Git could update and save your work in the wrong
    branch.
